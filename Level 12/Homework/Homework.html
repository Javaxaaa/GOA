    <h1><b>Juventus Team History</b></h1>

    <p>Juventus was founded as <b>Sport-Club</b> Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the <i><b>assimo d'Azeglio Lyceum</b></i> school in Turin, among them <i><b>Eugenio Canfari</b></i> and <b><i>Enrico Canfari</i></b>. It was renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later. The club joined the <i><b>1900</b></i> Italian Football Championship. Juventus played their first Italian Football Championship match on 11 March 1900 in a <b><i>1-0 defeat against Torinese</i></b>.

        In 1904, businessman Marco Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of Juventus, making it possible to transfer the training field from piazza d'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the 1905 Italian Football Championship while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time, the <b><i>club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County</i></b>.
        
        <b><i>There was a split at the club in 1906</i></b>, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin. <b><i> Alfred Dick, the club's president</i></b>, was unhappy with this, and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino, which in turn spawned the Derby della Mole. Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split,<b><i> surviving the First World War</i></b>.</p>
